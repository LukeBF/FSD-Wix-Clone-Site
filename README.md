# Wix Template Clone

# About the Project

## Description
A static website clone of the Wix template - Gym. Its only purpose is to provide information and imagery to the user and does not include any JavaScript functionality or features. Considered as a basic website with minimal features, the only web technologies used were HTML and CSS. These were used to practice the foundation concepts of website development.

## Challenges
- Using CSS grids to break up and align content
- Sourcing template image files
- Getting the hero image to scroll at a slower pace to the rest of the page

## Features
- Change color on hover over links (pseudo classes)
- Form controls
- Parallax scroll

## Features and upgrades to implement in the future:
- Instant message/chat feature
- Add more pages 
- Convert to React single page application (SPA)
- Implement JavaScript to make buttons clickable and action specific tasks

# Project Motivation
The main reason for doing this project was to get practice with the skeleton code of HTML and to practice using the different semantic and non-semantic tags. For CSS, it was to gain experience with styling groups of elements, as well as individual elements and/or sections of the web page. 

In terms of linking documents and resources, this project provided meaningful experience with linking external CSS files to the HTML document, and also external resources like Fontawesome and Google Fonts.
